# Chris-Capstone-Project


# Purpose/Problem Statement
My code generates random names to be volunteers from an API and assigns the volunteers 3 chores each

At Launchpad, 2 people are picked each week to clean the break room at the end of the day. I used that as inspiration for my code and tried to automate that process myself

# Target Audience 
My Target audience is Launchpad staff and students. Launchpad is a 2.5-year program where high school students learn how to code with Python and other coding languages and work-ready skills.

# Solution + Limitations 
My code solves the problem of manually picking who will do the chores. Since it is using an API, it is using random names instead of Launchpad students, which is its main limitation

# Key Features / Key Components 
User Interactive | Random User Data Fetching | Conditionals | For-Range Loops | Dictionaries | Slicing | Volunteer Pool Creation | Chore List | Randomized Assignment Logic | Chore Distribution | User Interaction | Error Handling

# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
At some point while creating my code, my API stopped working because the connection time was slow. I had to use an external coding website to be able to text and adjust my code

# Project Timeline 
Step 1: I was originally going to make a code using a calorie API to check the amount of calories in a meal, but the APIs required premium subscriptions
Step 2: I found the API I wanted to use, which was a random name API 
Step 3: I used the API to make volunteers for my previous chore-assigning code
Step 4: My API started running errors because the website had a bad connection, so I had to use anaconda.cloud because Techsmart's timeout window was too short 
Step 5: Once I finished implementing the API into the new code, I added my old chore project 
Step 6: I made changes to the old code to make it compatible with the new code
My code was then complete
