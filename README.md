# Chris-Capstone-Project


# Purpose/Problem Statement
    What does your program do? What problem/need is it addressing?
My code generates random names to be volunteers from an API and assigns the volunteers 3 chores each

At Launchpad, 2 people are picked each week to clean the break room at the end of the day. I used that as inspiration for my code and tried to automate that process myself

# Target Audience 
    Who is this for? (ex: students, gamers, young adults, etc.)
My Target audience is Launchpad staff and students

# Solution + Limitations 
    How does your project solve the problem? Are there actions your program would do to solve the problem, but doesnâ€™t do?
My code solves the problem of have to manually pick who will do the chores. Since it is using an API it is using random names instead of Launchpad students which is it's main limitation

# Key Features / Key Components 
    List major parts of your program (what the user can do or see).
User Interactive | Random User Data Fetching | Volunteer Pool Creation | Chore List | Randomized Assignment Logic | Chore Distribution | User Interaction | Error Handling

# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
    What was hard to figure out? What do you wish you could add if you had more time or more experience?
At some point while creating my code my API stopped working because the connection time wass slow. I had to use external coding website to be able to text and adjust my code

# Project Timeline 
    Briefly explain how you broke this project up across days, weeks, or months.
Step 1: I was originally going to make a code using a calorie API to check the amount of calories in a meal but the APIs required premium subscriptions
Step 2: I found the API i wanted to use which was a random name API 
Step 3: I used the API to make volunteers for my previous chore assigning code
Step 4: My API started running errors because the website haad bad connection so I had to use anaconda.cloud because techsmarts timeout window was too short 
Step 5: Once i finished implement the API into the new code I added my old chore project 
Step 6: I madde changes to the old code to make it compatible with the new code
My code was then complete
